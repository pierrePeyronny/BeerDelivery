# Run the project
- npm install
- ng serve

# highlights logic and code writing style
- I lazyloaded the deliveryModule to be ready for the applicationâ€™s future, with other modules to keep it easy and faster to load.  
- I followed Angular's style guide.


# What could have been done in a better way
- Checking more the datas received
- More Errors Handling
- More Unit tests
- Better design

# Version 2.0
- Update the truck and the containers to be able to manage the placement of each container in the truck depending on their temperatures.

- Check the number of bottles remaining per container => not to give alerts on an empty container.

- Send email/SMS to the driver in case of a temperature problem
- Better design !


# Question I had /answer
- Do the driver have access to the app while driving => Yes, he will be able to see an alert on a screen available for him.


# Other note
- It was the first time I ever used Unit Tests on the frontend with angular, so there is probably some mistakes and maybe all the test cases aren't covered
